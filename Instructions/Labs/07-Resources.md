## Microsoft Learn Modules

Take a look at the curated collection of [Microsoft Learn content](https://aka.ms/pbilearn). 

If you'd like to learn Power BI as a complete platform, I recommend you check out the [Learning Paths associated with the Power BI Data Analyst Associate certification](https://learn.microsoft.com/credentials/certifications/power-bi-data-analyst-associate/?azure-portal=true) (scroll down to follow the self-paced learning). Many of the modules include hands-on labs where you'll be able to practice what you've learned.

If you're looking for specific learning modules, use the search function on the [Learn platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/browse/?expanded=power-platform&products=power-bi).
