# What is Workout Wednesday?

**[Workout Wednesday](https://workout-wednesday.com/power-bi-challenges/)** is a weekly challenge to re-create a data-driven visualization. The challenges are designed to kick-start personal development in Power BI.

Each Wednesday a challenges are released and participants are asked to replicate the challenge that is posed as closely as possible. We'll provide you with either a solution file or a guided video.

Use Workout Wednesday to **practice data visualization**, **build your portfolio**, or **assign to your students**!
