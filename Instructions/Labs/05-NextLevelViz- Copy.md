# Lab 4 - Create next level visuals

In this lab, you'll select a custom visual to explore. Because of time constraints, you may only be able to explore one visual. 

Choose from the following options:

1) [Deneb Visuals - My First Deneb](https://workout-wednesday.com/pbi-2022-w37/): Spencer walks you through creating a bar chart using Deneb. This is a great way to get your feet wet with creating visuals using the vega/vega-lite declarative language.

2) [SVG Images - Add value to tables using SVGs](https://workout-wednesday.com/pbi-2023-w42/): Shannon walks you through different techniques to make your tables more informative, including using SVG images.

3) [PureViz Custom Visual from AppSource](https://workout-wednesday.com/pbi-2021-w35/): Shannon takes you through a custom visual from AppSource that allows you to create a variety of visuals using a single visual. This custom visual uses existing SVG images (rather than writing code to create an SVG image).

4) [Back to basics with core visuals](https://workout-wednesday.com/pbi-2023-w23/): Are you feeling overwhelmed with all of the options? Come back to basics with Shannon and learn create simple, minimalist designed bar chart using core visuals.
