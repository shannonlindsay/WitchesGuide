# Microsoft Learn Modules

Take a look at the curated collection of [Microsoft Learn content](https://aka.ms/pbilearn). 

If you'd like to learn Power BI as a complete platform, I recommend you check out the [Learning Paths associated with the Power BI Data Analyst Associate certification](https://learn.microsoft.com/credentials/certifications/power-bi-data-analyst-associate/?azure-portal=true) (scroll down to follow the self-paced learning). Many of the modules include hands-on labs where you'll be able to practice what you've learned.

If you're looking for specific learning modules, use the search function on the [Learn platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/browse/?expanded=power-platform&products=power-bi).

# Data Modeling

If you're ready to go beyond the basics and want to jump into data modeling, I highly recommend the **free** [Introduction to Data Modeling](https://www.sqlbi.com/p/introduction-to-data-modeling-for-power-bi-video-course/) course offered by my friends at SQLBI.

This is an introductory course about data modeling, which is a required skill to get the best out of Power BI, Power Pivot for Excel, and Analysis Services. It is aimed at users that do not have a background knowledge in data modeling for analytical systems and reporting.

# DAX

If you need to use any kind of calculations in your visualizations or reports, you need to understand the basics of DAX, the native language of Power BI, Power Pivot for Excel, and SSAS Tabular models in Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services. 

I recommend another **free** resource from our friends at SQLBI, [Introducing DAX](https://www.sqlbi.com/p/introducing-dax-video-course/).  The goal of this course is to teach the DAX language using Power BI for all the examples.
