# Lab 3 - Enhance visuals and reports

In this lab you'll learn how to enhance visuals and reports in Power BI. You'll learn how to create custom themes. You'll also learn how to use the accessibility checker to make sure your reports are accessible to everyone!

## Create a custom theme

Choose from one of two Workout Wednesday exercises, where you'll create a custom theme for your Power BI report.

1) David's theme challenge: [Workout Wednesday 2023 Week 21](https://workout-wednesday.com/pbi-2023-w21/)
2) Shannon's theme challenge: [Workout Wednesday 2022 Week 17](https://workout-wednesday.com/pbi-2022-w17/)

**Don't forget: To control more elements in your report, use the [Power BI Theme Generator](https://powerbi.tips/tools/theme-generator/) to help you create your custom theme!**

## Use the accessibility checker in Power BI

Use the accessibility checker on any Power BI report you have available to you (bonus points for checking the report you just created a theme for!). Make sure your report is accessible by using Stephanie's tool to check for tab order, alt text, and color contrast.

1) Navigate to the Workout Wenesday [Accessibility Checker](https://workout-wednesday.com/accessibility-checker/) challenge and follow the instructions to check your report.
2) Share your results with your peers and discuss how you can make your report more accessible.
3) Make a mental note to incorporate accessible design into your future reports.
