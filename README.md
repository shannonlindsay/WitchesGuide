# The Witch’s Guide to Model Management and Data Visualization

This is a public repository, containing materials used for the 2023 Fabric Community Conference.

## Session overview

Join us for a bewitching workshop on model management and data visualization with Power BI reporting. You'll learn how to use both inbuilt and third party tools to create efficient data models. You'll also discover how to enhance your visuals and reports with accessibility, design, and storytelling. As a part of this workshop, you'll practice your skills in interactive labs and get live feedback. At the end of the day, you'll be able to cast your own spells with data and create stunning reports!

## Prerequisites

This is a hands-on workshop. Please bring your enchanted laptops, already adorned with Power BI Desktop, and channel your inner sorcery. To ensure our potions brew harmoniously, it’s advisable to possess experience akin to what’s revealed in the sacred scrolls of the Dashboard in a Day workshop. This means you’ve connected to data, made changes using Power Query, created calculations using DAX, and created visuals.

Please ensure you have the following programs installed on your computer: Power BI Desktop, DAX Studio, and Tabular Editor.
